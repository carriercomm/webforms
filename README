This software is currently in production at Stanford University.

DESCRIPTION

REQUIREMENTS

INSTALLATION

Setting up the database
The software requires admin level access to a MySQL server so that it can create databases to hold individual form data. All data needed to render a form is stored in the fb database. This can be created first and then the tables created using "creates_tables.sql". There's a file called countries.sql under includes/data which will populate the database with 200 countries (useful for a drop down in an address field).

config.txt
Rename includes/config_sample.txt to config.txt and fill in the appropriate values

.htaccess
Rename .htaccess_sample to .htaccess and point the AuthUserFile to the location for your .htpasswd file (it needs to be the absolute path). By default, the username is test and password is test.

Javascript
You will need to install SpryTabbedPanels.css and SpryTabbedPanels.js from Adobe's Spry Framework under the /SpryAssets directory (Download them here: http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/home.html)
